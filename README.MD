test Tree maker

For now you need to copy script to your repository and add lodash and glob to your devDependencies.
Script searches for any spec files ts/js in dir you put it in and in every subdir.

It creates treeTest txt file with tree of test in your directory.
By default, it searches for description, context and it. 

Enjoy !
